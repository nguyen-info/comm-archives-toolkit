Working with artists allowed us to demonstrate how these collections and the project goals could be interpreted and reimagined in creative ways. It also allowed a new entry point into the collections.

* Kenya Adams, Armed: A Dance Demonstration—debuted at Hilltop Story Fest; inspired by Hilltop Stories
* Charles Carson, Take Me With You: Gifts from the Elders—Carson conducted a series of interviews with community elders and incorporated content from the NWR and CAC collections. These short documentaries will be accessible in ORCA.
