### Planning for long term preservation and access from the beginning

Following digital preservation standards and best practices, this helped determine access platforms for us as well. If you are unfamiliar with digital collection stewardship, we would suggest taking the free online course offered by WebJunction listed in the Appendix.

### Seeking other sources of funding

While the project was going on, applied for other opportunities that were aligned with the project or could continue funding the project. NEH submitted; received Memory Lab grant which will provide a new channel for growing the collection

### Thinking about sustainability from the beginning

Establish programs and procedures that can continue even without dedicated staffing; utilize staff in your organization outside of the project team to make the project scalable
