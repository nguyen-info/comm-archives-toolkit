In addition to strengthening partnerships with external organizations, it was important for the team to build its internal capacity to carry out the project. This included the following steps:

<details>

<summary>2.5.1 Regular meetings and collaborative spaces</summary>

The team established a bi-weekly meeting schedule to discuss progress and plan next steps. Trammell established the agendas for these meetings and also facilitated them. The team also established a shared Google Drive for collaborative work.&#x20;

<summary>2.5.2 Conduct library meetings</summary>

We gave presentations to various TPL staff groups about the project including Adult Services, Youth Services, and some library branches. In these meetings, we provided examples of how library staff across the system could engage with the project.&#x20;

Some examples included:&#x20;

* helping to facilitate connections with individuals and organizations who may be interested in being involved with the project
* encouraging attendance at workshops and engagement with other initiatives
* co-designing programming that may generate content for the CAC collections (for example, oral history or written reflection activities).&#x20;

We also gave a presentation to the TPL Board of Trustees to update the Board of Trustees and to solicit their advice on potential partners for the project. See [Appendix A](../appendix-further-reading-and-resources/appendix-a.-planning-and-launch-resources.md#board-of-trustees-and-staff-presentation) for the presentation slides.&#x20;

Throughout the project, Trammell and barrow kept library staff updated on project progress through presentations and information in a weekly staff library email newsletter.

<summary>2.5.3 Develop project branding and website</summary>

The TPL graphic designer created project branding (including a logo and color palette), and we also developed a [project webpage within the Library’s website](https://www.tacomalibrary.org/communityarchives/).&#x20;

One important feature of the TPL webpage was a contact form that allowed community members to submit questions about the project or indicate their interest in getting involved. An email address was also established for the project. The UW TASCHA research group produced a [supporting project site](https://tascha.uw.edu/projects/the-community-archives-center-for-tacoma/).

<summary>2.5.4 Expand library staffing</summary>

TPL hired a full time Community Archives Center Project Associate. The salary and benefits for this position were fully funded by the grant for 1.5 years. The position was union-represented at the Associate level. The Associate classification level was intentionally selected. Associate level employees at TPL can play a leading role in organizing programs and independently working on a range of projects but  are not required to have an MLIS degree.&#x20;

By not classifying the position to require an MLIS degree, candidates from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences would be eligible. While prior experience in libraries, archives, and museums is helpful for the role, the Project Team prioritized experience and skills related to outreach and community engagement.&#x20;

Because Trammell and other TPL archives and special collections staff had the necessary expertise in archival theory and practice, the need for someone who could lead outreach efforts and develop community connections was considered critical to the success of the project and more important in the selection process.&#x20;

The job description was posted on the City of Tacoma jobs portal. It was also distributed to all project partners who were encouraged to share it with their networks. The hiring committee consisted of Trammell, two members of the Northwest Room Archives and Local History Collections staff, and the Outreach Librarian. See [Appendix A](../appendix-further-reading-and-resources/appendix-a.-planning-and-launch-resources.md#job-descriptions) for Project Associate and Intern job descriptions.

After the position offer had been accepted, a posting for a Community Archives Center Project Intern was distributed. The paid Intern position was designed for a current student (undergraduate or graduate) or recent graduate.&#x20;

Trammell and the newly-hired Associate conducted interviews and selected the successful candidate. The position was funded by the grant and tied to the academic semester. The Intern’s responsibilities included:&#x20;

* supporting outreach events and activities
* uploading and creating metadata for new materials collected for the Community Archives Center
* digitizing existing materials that support the goals of the Community Archives Center

Over the course of the project a total of five interns were employed on the project through grant funding. They were students from four different local colleges and universities and were studying history, environmental science, languages, and library and information science.
