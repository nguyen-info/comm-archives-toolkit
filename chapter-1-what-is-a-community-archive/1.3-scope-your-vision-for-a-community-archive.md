# 1.3 Scope Your Vision for a Community Archive

This section will review 5 (five) known different levels and models of community archives and community archiving practices. We will define each level, requirements to achieve the model, and provide examples of existing community archives. While these models have shown some successes and challenges, there are always opportunities to create new formats and models that serve and support your specific community, particularly since each community has their own histories, relationships, resources, needs, and interests. The archives listed below are not endorsements, but referenced as examples to review and included due to the availability of literature around their work and collections. Check out [Appendix ](../appendix-further-reading-and-resources/appendix-c.-examples-of-community-archives.md)[C](../appendix-further-reading-and-resources/appendix-c.-examples-of-community-archives.md) for a non-comprehensive list of examples for further exploration.

<summary>1.3.1 Post-custodial with no collection of physical materials</summary>

#### **Definition**

A post-custodial community archive practices that “records are retained by their creator with archives providing oversight and support functions” ([Ham, 1981](https://doi.org/10.17723/aarc.44.3.6228121p01m8k376)).

* This approach “uses digital technology in pursuit of a more collaborative approach to multinational archival work. The model originated as a response to the rapid increase of born-digital materials produced by institutions, a way of saying “archive your own emails.” But it was quickly taken up by archivists interested in human rights and social justice as a way to shift the balance of power in archival preservation.” ([Smith, 2018](https://www.clir.org/2018/10/post-custodial-archiving/)).&#x20;
* “creators retain custody of their records, consequently shifting ownership and access to the communities represented, rather than being handed over to larger and wealthier institutions” ([Suárez, 2021](https://blogs.princeton.edu/techsvs/tag/post-custodial-models/))
* Stakeholders: creator from community, archives

#### **Requirements**

1. Creators take on record manager roles
2. Decentralization of material/physical holdings
3. Make use of modern technology to systematize centralize access. “To do this work equitably, we must think critically about the hardware and software choices that we’re making, and their impact on our digital interfaces.” ([Smith, 2018](https://www.clir.org/2018/10/post-custodial-archiving/))
4. Establish coherent and comprehensive acquisition program
5. “Rebalance power between colonizer/colonized, global South/global North, and repository/creator” ([Carbajal, 2018](https://www.slideshare.net/ItzaCarbajal/postcustodial-methods-in-archival-practice)).—“prioritize and fund relationships first” through the “maintenance of long-term relationships” building “equitable partnerships, especially given a national history of betrayal and exploitation, depend on trust built through long-term, personal relationships.” ([Smith, 2018](https://www.clir.org/2018/10/post-custodial-archiving/))
6. Relocate archival enterprise responsibilities, practices, and expectations—“(re)locates the work of the archivist to be neither only the institutional repository nor the site of records creation, but rather a third space that crosses borders between the two and can function in both but belongs wholly to neither.” ([Kelleher, 2017](https://doi.org/10.24242/jclis.v1i2.29))
7. Diversity and democratize historical records—“shift curatorial authority and access to the communities represented. In this model, archivists work side-by-side with community members to actively rectify gaps in historical coverage and proactively document the present day.” ([Becerra-Licha, 2017](https://er.educause.edu/articles/2017/10/participatory-and-post-custodial-archives-as-community-practice))

* It is common for these archives to be interpreted as non-professional archival initiatives and as “projects and endeavors which are actively engaged in radical or counter-hegemonic public history-making activities” ([Flinn, 2011](https://doi.org/10.5070/D472000699)). \\
