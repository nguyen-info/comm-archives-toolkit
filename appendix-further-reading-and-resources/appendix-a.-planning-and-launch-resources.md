### Grant Development, Sustainability, Funding Resources

* [Preliminary and Final Grant Proposals for IMLS Grant](https://imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-250126-ols-21) (LG-250126-OLS-21)â€”The Tacoma Public Library will bring community members and organizations together to carry out a fully participatory process to broaden participation and inclusion within cultural heritage collections. This will create a model for institutions in small- and mid-sized urban areas seeking to enter collaborative partnerships with diverse groups to produce more equitable archives. This work contributes to greater understanding of how to develop better models of community partnerships for supporting community archives and how to expand knowledge of the impact of archives on urban communities.
